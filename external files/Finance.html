<h1>The Neoliberal Mentality on the Destruction of Liberal Arts and Democracy</h1>

<p>It is understood that the primary ‘market mentality’ under the force of neoliberalism is one where all aspects of human nature are reified into economic interest under the umbrella of human capital. In this way, human capital is the idea that non-economic engagements, from reading a book or getting a college degree, are undertaken to enrich human capital and improve skillsets. In the end this surplus of human capital is utilized to increase the potential to generate economic capital in the form of wealth. When analyzing neoliberalism’s relationship to higher education and democracy, it becomes clear that neoliberalism’s fundamental essence works to erode those institutions. This is true because the neoliberal model—a model of laissez-faire economics that developed out of the latter twentieth century—detaches cultural institutions and people from their original functions and commodifies them under the forces of the market. While the historical function of the liberal arts education was tied to improving democracy through the development of collective paideia and social equality, neoliberalism has undermined this connection through entrenching ideas of human capital into academia—pushing people towards ‘practical’ majors, increasing tuitions costs, student debt, and class division.</p>
	
<p>To begin to understand the specific impact of neoliberalism on the liberal arts model of education, it is valuable to see the transformation of higher education from its inception to the present and to see the fundamental link this had to democratic discourse in post-war America. In her 2015 essay “Educating Human Capital,” Wendy Brown contends the Western idea of liberal arts specifically is intrinsically tied to the promotion of democracy: “Even in classical antiquity the liberal arts (rooted in liberus, the Latin word for individual freedom) denoted the education appropriate to free men, in contrast to that of slaves. A liberal arts education, in other words, was necessary for free men to know and engage the world sufficiently to exercise that freedom” (Brown 184). While Brown acknowledges the historical situation of liberal arts education was hardly democratic, being available only to white men of a certain socioeconomic class, she argues the historical context of post-World War II America created the appropriate climate for the broadening of education to a wider demographic. In what Brown describes as a ‘radical departure’ from the class distinct education of yore she contends the following:</p>

<p id="QuoteIndent">For the first time in human history, higher-educational policy were oriented toward the many, tacitly destining them for intelligent engagement with the world, rather than economic servitude or mere survival. In this respect, far more than class mobility and equality of opportunity were advanced by a liberal arts education generalized across society. Rather, the ideal of democracy was being realized in a new way insofar as the demos was being prepared through education for a life of freedom, understood as both individual sovereignty (choosing and pursuing one’s ends) and participation in collective self-rule (Brown 188). </p>

<p>While Brown acknowledges the value of broadly available education in promoting social mobility and equality by equalizing access to learning, it can be said that she sees the propagation of paideia—the ancient Greek ideal for the rounded education required to produce an effective member of society and the polis—to be the most important aspect of liberal arts education.</p>

<p>In this way, the fortitude of democracy in America can be seen as grounded on a broadly accessible liberal arts education. After noting how the liberal arts works to promote democratic values in America through the promotion of social mobility, democratic self-rule, and freedom, it has to be understood what aspects of neoliberalism operate to undermine these values and thus undermine democracy as a whole. The most prominent force in the degradation of liberal arts and democracy is the institutionalization of human capital. The tendency of people, according to the ideas of neoliberalism, is to partake in actions that help accumulate human capital. In the same sense we sell goods to accumulate money, we teach ourselves a trade or learn a language to accrue human capital. This idea is harped on by Gary S. Becker in his speech “The Economic Way of Looking at Life:”</p>

<p id="QuoteIndent">One of the most influential theoretical concepts in human capital analysis is the distinction between general and specific training or knowledge…This distinction helps explain why workers with highly specific skills are less likely to quit their jobs and are the last to be laid... It also explains why most promotions are made from within a firm rather than through hiring—workers need time to learn about a firm’s structure and “culture”—and why better accounting methods would include the specific human capital of employees among the principle asset of most companies (Becker 8-9). </p>

<p>In one sense, Becker remarks about the ways in which we use human capital as an asset to build our value. This passage however, prominently underlines the psychology that has disrupted the democratic education Wendy Brown spoke of in her essay. Because specific training is seen as more secure and valuable than generalized training, the ‘market mentality’ of neoliberalism has driven the individual away from democratic foundations like the liberal arts and towards specialization. This mode of thinking, thinking in terms of human capital, is what can be understood as the principle force that has caused a downturn and loss of faith in the liberal arts model. Subjects of neoliberalism no longer see the liberal arts as a relevant tool, as it does not explicitly manifest its value in terms of security and ability to generate economic capital. This sentiment is mimicked by Pierre Bourdieu in his essay “The Forms of Capital:”</p> 

<p id="QuoteIndent">It [is] possible to establish conversion rates between cultural capital and economic capital by guaranteeing the monetary value of a given academic capital. This…establishes value in terms of cultural capital…relative to other qualification holders and…the monetary value for which it can be exchanged on the labor market (academic investment has no meaning unless a minimum degree of reversibility… is objectively guaranteed)…The strategies for converting economic capital into cultural capital, which are among the short term factors of the schooling explosion and the inflation of qualifications, are governed by changes in the structure of the chances of profit offered by different types of capital (Bourdieu 21).</p>

<p>On one hand Bourdieu accepts the idea of valuing education in terms of human capital to economic capital conversions—a sentiment held in similar esteem by Gary S. Becker but rejected by Wendy Brown. By the same token, Bourdieu rejects Brown’s contention that the explosion in schooling (which he never specifically grounds in time) and qualification is caused by the democratization of education. Rather, Bourdieu argues this explosion is best understood as an improvement in the conversion rate of human capital to economic capital. This is where the danger in neoliberal mentality lies, as neoliberalism is blind to any force that does not manifest itself in strict return on investment. That is to say neoliberalism is blind to the value of the liberal arts as a bastion of equality, paideia, and democracy, and in fact goes so far as to actively undermine its value.</p> 

	<p>Insofar as neoliberalism has undermined the liberal arts through the institutionalization of human capital centered thinking, it also has disrupted the promotion of social mobility and class equality by driving up tuition costs and creating a class of living debtors.  Annie Mcclanahan evidences this volume of debt in her essay “The Living Indebted: Student Militancy and the Financialization of Debt:”</p> 

<p id="QuoteIndent">However the largest increase in student lending has actually been in the fully private sector, in speculative lending: according to the College Board, private education loans grew from $3 billion in 1997–98 to $19.1 billion in 2007–8; as of 2010 they accounted for over 12 percent of all student lending, up from approximately 3 percent at the beginning of the 2000s. By one estimate, these types of loans are on track to outpace federal loans within the next ﬁfteen years (Mclanahan 59).
</p>   
<p>This drastic rise in student debt Mcclanahan argues, is the product of a number of factors that are produced under the system of neoliberal economics. The primary one however, is what she refers to as the ‘financialization of debt’. Under the burden of a neoliberal market mentality, the historical idea of a line of credit was expanded to include the trade of bundled debts as assets. In doing this, a speculative market of ‘securitization’ arose that sought to exchange long term debts for liquid capital. This neoliberal mentality has incentivized the expansion of private student debt, according to Mcclanahan far beyond a rise proportional to the rise in tuition: “The growth in student debt is not simply due to the staggering increase in university tuitions over the last decade. Rather, as UC Santa Cruz professor Robert Meister has suggested, universities feel they can raise fees even in times of economic crisis precisely because of the availability of private as well as federally insured student loans” (Mcclanahan 60).</p>

	<p>This creation of a system of predatory lending has driven the cost of college attendance higher than ever seen before and driven a cleft in the broad availability of higher education that Wendy Brown argues is the basis for democratic self-rule. Furthermore, Mcclanahan contends that the delayed nature of student debt has a tendency to suppress radical political action from students and thus work to further perpetuate the injustice. Because of this, it can be said that the mentality of neoliberalism, as it works to commodify all things, also works to undermine higher education through treating it first as a good and not a public service.</p> 
	
	<p>Because Neoliberalism’s modus operandi is one where all things fall under the forces of economics, the stability of higher education as a cornerstone of democracy and social mobility is undermined. Mentalities about human capital leech into education and deflate the worth of the liberal arts, as well as mounting student debt and radical financialization of the credit industry fracture the social mobility of higher education. Due to forces like these, it can be said that the disruption of democracy and education in contemporary society is a product of the neoliberal market mentality.</p>
