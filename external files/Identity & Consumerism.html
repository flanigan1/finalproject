<h1>Identity &amp; Consumerism</h1>
<h2>How consumerism sells you identity</h2>
<p><i>by Brady Flanigan</a></i></p>
<P>Since the birth of industrial capitalism in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the means of crafting one’s own identity against the backdrop of society has gradually been altered in favor of the producer. More specifically, since the creation of a unique consumer culture at the turn of the twentieth century, the character of people in industrial societies has forever been intertwined to the commodities they consume. That is to say, the means of defining oneself in consumer societies is coercively associated with the consumption of commodities. By surreptitiously promising a purchase-able sense of self, the producer can market a lost piece of identity with the knowledge that man will blindly follow in hopes of recovering their lost sense of self.</P> 
<P>The findings of social psychologists of the last fifty odd years supports the fact that the human consciousness has the tendency to view itself in  a series of overlapping identities—where it exists as either an individual identity or a reified group identity. Although this reification forms the basis of the invention of group identity and group psychology, this form of identity only exists as a farce the individual puts up for various reasons. The kernel of consciousness that separates the individual from the world remains nonetheless. That is to say, no matter whether an individual slips himself into the outlook of her/his group, they still fundamentally operate on the grounding of their individual consciousness, which seeks to affirm its uniqueness by subtly separating itself from the group without being rejected from it.</P>  
<p>Due to this perennial fact, it can be said that although the members of one’s community do make up one’s sense of self, this operates in conjunction with one’s need to legitimize their own consciousness. Primarily, the means the individual goes about this is by separating himself inside the community.</p> 
<p>Imagine a specific sect of Protestantism, for example, and now imagine one of their devout followers. This person’s position in a specific sect (a form of group identity) separates him, along with the other members of his sect, from those not in his sect—those outside the group identity in what is referred to in social psychologists circles as an ‘out-group’. In this way, man’s position inside a specific system (one among many that he is intentionally or unintentionally involved in), which exists separate him from other systems and the world at large, ultimately informs a piece of who he is or how he sees himself as separate from the universe.</p> 
<p>This example however, only informs the man of his group identity—how the system which he a part of is separate from the world, not how he is separate him the system, which begs the question why a group identity is necessary at all. One could ask, ‘why does man need a system to separate him from the world at large? Can’t he directly distinguish himself against the stage of the universe without the presence of a system given his consciousness acts as its own entity? On an abstract level, it would seem a logical question to extend from the discussion of identity. This way of looking at identity though, completely denies the simple fact humans naturally organize themselves into groups with the intent of creating a group identity to revel around and distinguish from other opposing or separate group identities. To deny the existence of this is to deny the existence of society itself, which operates as the basic organizational group identity—the one which separates man from nature: the one which spawns all other forms of group identities.</p>   
<p>So then, if the group identity only separates a system from other systems, only informs the man he is not whatever is outside the system, how does he prove to himself he isn’t the system as a whole, or that he is unique inside that system? Utilizing the same tactic as the group identity, the man then differentiates himself against the back drop of the system he is in to produce a self-identity: a unique position inside the group identity. The ways in which a person goes about doing this vary greatly, but since all accomplish the same ends, the means aren’t specifically relevant to the nature of this essay.</p>
<p>Thus, man can position himself against the universe by identifying with a group, then positioning himself against the group by finding a unique position or function inside it.  From these two separate but linked forms of identity, we can introduce the total identity or self—the synthesis of a group and individual identity.</p> 
<p>To use an example, in a trope over-explored in fiction, the meaning of a superhero character—whose group identity is the bulk of all do-gooders, and whose self-identity is separated on the basis of how he goes about doing good, things such as vigilantism, clothing, ethical code, etc.—is only there when the supervillain exists to contrast the superhero’s (codified as a struggle between in-group and out-group). In this way, group identities only exist within something to form as a background—what the group identity isn’t.</p>
<p>Using these terms to think about identity, I now draw onto my basic assertion. Modern consumer capitalism, has detached man from his capacity to form a self-identity by depriving him of a background in the collective identity to separate himself from, and make himself whole. Furthermore, by instilling a mindset of community conspicuous consumption in the subjects of consumerism, private industry has hijacked many of the forms of traditional collective identity, rendered them superfluous, and replaced them with the consumption of commodities. In this way, the subject continues to consume, continues to form collective identities within private industry, in the hopes of one day being able to create a self-identity that will ultimately make him whole. If the powers that be were to allow the consumer to create a total identity though,  he would be more or less fulfilled as a human being and be broken from the endless consumption of searching for a piece of oneself.</p>  
<p>To understand why capitalism’s basic makeup has the effect of detaching man from his self-identity is to understand the nature of capitalism’s unique trait, commodity reproduction, in relationship to the creation of an identity. While the institutions of old existed in one way or another, be it through conversion or birthright or inheritance etc., primarily to offer man a group and therefore individual identity (of which he has many) with the ends of synthesizing a total identity.</p>
<p>In this way, the search for meaning is the search for identity—the search for community and unique position or function inside the community: the feeling of being indispensable to a community they value. Conversely, the function of the assembly line is to produce commodities of no individual consequence—goods completely dispensable in the face of sheer volume.</p> 
<p>And by the skillful use of advertisement, capitalism has deceitfully connected the consumption of commodities to the underpinned need for community in human existence. But because the market produces assembly-line goods, goods without a sense of self, one cannot expect to form a self-identity by consuming these commodities. This is the trick of the cult of advertisement, though. This is its purpose—to keep man in a search for his self-identity.</p>
	<p>Moreover, it can be said institutions that once existed independently of profit have been commodified by the forces of the market and diverted towards tactics of depriving the individual of his/her self-identity. For example, the presence of community for many was historically manifest in the form of the neighborhood. If one is to look at neighborhoods from the era of pre-consumerism, homes tended to follow a general architectural style but differed as much as they overlapped. Conversely, during the time of post-WWII America, it occurred to American homebuilders that if homes were stamped out in assembly-line fashion—subjected to the forces of mechanical reproduction—such as the hamlets of Levittown New York or earlier corporate towns, it became apparent to them that reproducibility is profitable. This in many ways explains the propagation of the assembly line model across industries. From here families flocked to cookie-cutter towns—pulled by the forces of billboards and radio ads promising a sense of community for the low fee of mechanical reproduction. But once families arrived—expenses exhausted—they realized the individual identity the cult of advertising promised is not there.</p>
<p>More so, because of the expansion of identity consumerism into the housing market, as it has into every other industry in industrial society, the alternatives to this model no longer exist—driving away desire to find a home that can offer a self-identity. This of course would be predicated upon the consumer’s knowledge of this as the source of their longing, which simply isn’t so, as the consumer culture has summed up this discontent as the product of not consuming enough rather than what it really is.</p>
<p>This effect of commodities on the human identity does not originate from the commodities themselves however, as human have lived alongside goods for nearly all of their history. Conversely, the oppressive quality of commodities comes from their means of creation rather than the commodity itself. This was catalyzed by the rise of the cult of advertising in the beginning of the twentieth century. These factors really cement themselves as the new means of identity only when they diminish old-world identity institutions. It is of little surprise that consumer societies witness the death of god in the face of the consumption of goods. At some point early in the history of consumerism it occurred to advertisers that the person content with their sense of identity is in no serious need to consumer superfluous commodities, so industry sought to disrupt the powers of old in all aspects of society and then, by the tactic of associating goods with the unconscious need to find a self-identity, convince him to consume indefinitely.</p>  
<p>It important to note that although consumerism seeks to actively destroy institutions of identity creation, and has to many extents succeeded in subverting them, it has not absolutely disrupted all forms of collective identity. The fact nonetheless, is that consumerism seeks to destroy these institutions and replace them with collective identities centered on private enterprise, where the means of acquiring a self-identity is centered on the consumption of un-individual goods.</p> 
<p>It should also be noted that just because these institutions of old did indeed serve to produce identities, does not secure them as either just or superior. Rather, like the brand affiliation of today, and in the tune of a superhero-supervillain complex, collective identities existed on the lines of in-groups and out-groups—as noted in the works of Social Identity Theory (which carries its own internal flaws)—some institutions such as Nazism and white supremacy—which defined themselves by their fanatical opposition to other collective identities. In the same way, brands have continued the ugliest traditions of old and subverted them to an ends of profit.</p>
<p>It should be noted that between the fields of SIT and SCT great contributions have been made to the understanding of group identity and its workings; however it can be said these bodies of work do have failings. In this case, these two theories fail to effectively treat the role of the individual inside a system. More or less, they contend the self is lost to the group; the farthest from that is true. The self actively exists in the way it does outside group identity; one’s sense of self does not cease to exist when one enters into group identity. It merely is subverted to keeping hold of itself by means of the group.</p> 
<p>The phenomenon of depersonalization for example, noted by proponents of self-categorization theory, that is to say that the individual alternates between group and individual identities, and that in times of group identity one ‘self-stereotypes’ in order to better fulfill their role in the group is to say that this action in no way uniquely informs them of who they are as a person. This however, only holds true in the case of a large distance of examination. What I mean is this, on a singular basis, imagine an army officer self-stereotypes with other army officers to fulfill his group identity better—to align with other officers he mimics their attitudes. Although he does this, from within his perspective, he still holds an unspoken individual identity by comparing himself to his personal squadron or immediate vicinity.</p>  
<p>Furthermore, the contention depersonalization is a natural product of human psychology would indicate that this happens in all group identities to more or less this same degree. This is known to be untrue, however. It’s a ready truth that some group identities weed out individual identities more than a universal force of human psychology. The most prominent among these being the reproductive nature of industrial capitalism—its impact coming not from its specific capacity to disassociate people from themselves, as many institutions do this with greater intensity but rather its scope. The expanse of consumerism in industrialized society makes this depravation of identity inescapable and thus seditious.</p>
<p>Even more so, it could be said the auto-radicalization that comes as an extension of in-group out-group struggle can also be mirrored inside the self-consciousness in ways loosely akin to the Hegelian master-slave dialectic. The struggle between depersonalization and exclusion from the group identity in many ways mirrors the conflict between group identities, except in-group out-group conflict pushes opposing identities farther apart while the self-consciousness struggles dialectically in hopes of striking a balance between depersonalization and exclusion</p>  
<p align="center">Internet and identity:</p>
<p>Although the reign of identity-consumerism and the cult-of-advertising predominate the lives of the modern person, a note-worthy counter tide has come out of the rise of the internet in the twentieth century—which in many ways propagated the expansion of identity-consumerism that it did dispel it, also came the rise of a new redemptive form of collective identity whose creation can be explained as the consequence of living in a society void of identity forming communities. More specifically, what I’m referring to is the rise of the internet forum as a vehicle for identity acquisition. These institutions tend to circumvent identity-consumerism by not marketing to the consumer but rather by marketing to the market itself.</p>
<p>That is, rather than marketing unoriginal commodities to consumers, forums generate revenue by either the benevolence of its members, who could really be said to be paying for the Total-identity in ways no different than church or taxes used to operate, or by offering the markets outlets for advertising (which though exacerbating the problem long term, does alleviate immediate pressure on the individual).</p>    

<p>Furthermore, it could be noted that suicide—a phenomenon that in many ways can be said to be a logical extension of identity depravation—is expounded upon under the forces of consumerism. After all, it would be more reasonable than Durkheim’s findings, which rest upon consumerism creating a new purpose to die, to assume that consumer societies expand on old causes at suicide than invent new ones.</p> 
<p>Thus, the lack of integration that Durkheim pegs as a cause of ‘egoistic suicide’ is not the cause of natural lack of integration, as he never fully expounds (further research needed) on the causes of this phenomenon, but rather is an intentional depravation imposed by the nature of consumerism—which begins by fetishizing mechanically reproduced commodities and then extending this practice and reifying it into all aspects of society.</p>
<p>The fact that altruistic suicide only occurs in institutions with extreme depravation of the individual identity is evidenced in the very act of altruistic suicide itself. By sacrificing oneself to the group, the individual can once and finally separate himself without excluding himself and synthesize his identity through the action of dying. It does not seem unheard of that people will go all the way to the grave in search of themselves.</p>
<p>According to philosopher Jeff Edmonds, whose analysis of my thesis formed the basis of my primary research, “capitalism works through the creation of unsatisfied desire, at the level of the self.” Although this statement itself is a good caricature of how consumer society affects the identity, I think it is fairer to argue that consumerism works by offering passage into a group identity and superficially promising an individual identity, which it later moved to deprive you of. Furthermore, It can be said that this is not necessarily an extension of capitalism, which is described primarily by the symptom of having a free market; this phenomenon is the consequence of mechanical reproduction and the cult of advertising themselves. Nonetheless Jeff’s statement is a good affirmation of my basis argument. More so, he contended that effective group identity is not a matter of what group identities one has but rather how those various institutions reinforce positive and productive values in society; although I agree with this argument, including it would be disruptive to the nature of this topic and would obligate me to make an ethical argument that would undermine the nature of this essay as a piece of critical theory. All in all, his perspective was valuable in reinforcing the basis of my thesis.</p>
<p>As it has been noted through a multitude of examples, the properties of mechanical reproduction—which stem as modern by-product of the capitalist system, has been exploited by consumer advertising to seditiously deprive the individual of their sense of self-identity. This ultimately operates to divert the attention of towards the consumption of commodities. Furthermore, these institutions have deprived the individual of older group identities to further expand the phenomenon of identity depravation. Although this can be understood as an unintentional consequence of the system itself, it still manages to effect the way we live and think.</p>
