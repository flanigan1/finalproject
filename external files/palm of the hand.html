<h1>The Rainy Season</h1>
<h2>Another piece of fiction by a new author</h2>
<p><i>by Brady Flanigan</i></p>

<p>The ground across middle Tennessee was soft and cold from the rain. It rained all through the night, and when the sun rose it was still trickling down—still falling through the trees and over the fields and down the hills and along the streets of Nashville and Chattanooga and Memphis. It rained until night, when the grey sky crawled away lonely over the curve of the earth and out of view. The sky was black then, and the trees were orange and yellow, and the ground was soft and cold from the rain. When it rains like that, the civil war leaks up through the ground: comes up as bullets and cannon balls and belt buckles, because when the ground is soft the past seeps through.</p>
<p>Joe stood on his porch looking towards the trees. Out back on the edge of the tree line, by some fallen trees, there was a ring of straw bales around a brick fire pit, and a fire was burning. Joey sat scraping the mud off his dress loafers, and the wind was blowing, and the fire shimmered through the trees like memories. His car was still in the driveway, and he was still wearing his blazer and slacks. Christy was sitting across from him—staring through the fire towards Joe and the electric lights strung along the porch. He stepped off the porch and into the mud and walked across the yard to the fire.</p>
<div id="QuoteIndent">
	<p>“It’s good you came to see us, Reynolds.”</p>
	<p>“I have a rep not that far from here.”</p>
 <p>Joey was staring into the trees while he spoke.</p>
	<p>“What’re you looking at?</p> 
<p>“I was just thinking about what’s happening in St. Louis. Jordan’s staying at a friend’s in the Ozarks.”</p> 
	<p>“Are you worried? That’s what we were doing when we were his age.”</p>
	<p>“We rolled your Suzuki on the levy one summer, too.”</p>
<p>“Is he old enough to go to war?”</p>
	<p>“Don’t say that.”</p>
<p>“Is he?”</p>
<p>“I just want to know what he’s up to. It’s harder to be close to kids than it used to be.”</p>
</div> 
 <p>Joey lifted his feet onto the fire pit and looked at Christy through the flames.</p>
 <div id="QuoteIndent">
<p>“Chris, have you been playing any recently?”</p>
</div>
<p>Joe stood up and leaned over the fire, as the lights from the porch spilled empty into the dark.</p> 
<div id="QuoteIndent">
<p>“Didn’t I tell you I bought her a Martin? She stopped seeing the instructor two months ago, and I told her we should build a studio out back.”</p>
<p>“You should get it and play something, Chris.”</p>
<p>“Not tonight.”</p>
</div>
<p>Her eyes were the color of the ashes on Joe’s boots. They both looked at their house in the distance like it was carving away the sky and replacing it with bricks.</p> 
<div id="QuoteIndent">
<p>“It’s a good house, momma.” He put his hand on her shoulder, and she lowered her head.</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
</div>
	<p>Reynolds straightened up.</p>
<div id="QuoteIndent">
<p>“Imagine what it must’ve been like to be the first person to settle this part of the world.”</p>
</div>
	<p>Joe rolled his head around, and said “Would’ve been some time in the 1780s.”</p>
	<div id="QuoteIndent">
<p>“Imagine what it must’ve been like though. To leave the world and march over the mountains that divide civilization from the void, and to cross over that line and see a world made from one giant brush stroke of red and yellow and brown—glowing in the sun and rolling on forever into infinity. It must’ve been so inviting. I can see why a person would want to walk into the forest. To just walk and walk and walk until you’re tired, and wherever you stop you decide to settle and live out the rest of your life with that view. Imagine the first person to settle your property.”</p>
<P>“I’ve been trying to get Christy to move to Alaska and do that for twenty years, Joey. She’s too civilized.”
“We haven’t even been married twenty years.”</P>
		<p>“Didn’t your granddad do that, Chris?”</p>
<p>“Granddaddy John homesteaded the town I grew up in. He settled with a mule and all the kids in the back of a trailer-wagon. It was just a field full of crickets and sycamores in West Kentucky.”</p>
<p>“Think about his first night alone. When God turned the lights off in the forest, and all the golds and browns and reds went black and all the world shrank to the distance from him to the tree line. Think about what it must’ve been like to light the first fire. Can you imagine what it must have felt like? God left him in the dark, so he invented fire and became God himself.” 
<p>“That’s how I felt when Christy and I left St. Louis and moved here, but now I have all this.”</p> 
</div>
The wind rolled through the trees towards Joey, and the leaves blew and scattered across the lawn all the way to the house. Joe drew in a long breath and huffed all the air out at once. The wind kept blowing for a minute, and the leaves kept falling, and everything was silent except for the crackle of autumn burning in the fire pit.</p>
<p>Reynolds thought about his house back home. He saw the tiny yellow windows and the tiny porch covering the cherry front door, and he imagined the trees out front—dead and brittle and standing lonely at the windy end of an endless suburb on the edge of his hometown. The house he bought with his wife after they discovered she was pregnant something like twenty years ago. Not far from when Joe first met Christy. Her name was Mary then: when she wrote gospel songs that she mailed back home to momma to be played in her childhood church. Right now his home was empty. Dianne divorced him around the same time Joe and Christy moved to Nashville to ride the housing market to wherever the top was. That was five years ago now.</p> 
<p>Christy scanned her eyes along the horizon above the house like she was looking for those five years so she could give them back to Joey. Maybe she was scanning the lines of an invisible bible in the stars. Maybe she was looking for Mary in between the verses.</p>  
<p>Joe stared into the windows of house and tried to see through them, but the lights were off and from where he was standing the inside was no different from the outside. All three of them hung around the fire, but none of them were there, and the sky was black, and the trees were orange and yellow, and the ground was soft and cold from the rain.</p>
