<p>Everyone was pressed up against each other and the railing---three feet from the edge of the stage where the lights were glowing out over the six-thousand people and into the dark. People were stacked on each other's shoulders and crawling over concrete barriers, falling, stumbling over tufts of grass on the sloped lawn.</p>

<p>And in the front---one body from the front was Two, watching the lights glow over the shoulder of the blond in the black corduroy dress in front of him. She was up against the railing with her huge ass pressed against his waist. She wasn't event watching the music. Her eyes were locked onto the edge of the concrete stage, while she twisted around to the sound of the LSD music in her head...the music Two imagined she was dancing to, but he knew she wasn't. She was too composed. And too beautiful. He was pushed behind her when a guy in a lab coat and swim trunks threw-up Budweiser and ran off into the dark. The whole crowd had to shuffle aside to make room for it.</p>

<p>He thought she looked just like his mother. He never got to see her face though. She never turned around to look at him---only grinded into his waist, and little by little, made Two certain he was in love with the faceless blond with the huge-moving-ass in the black dress. He stood there and listened to the music blur and distort, as the voices behind him wrapped around his head.</p>

<p> We were a mistake.</p>

<p>I hardly think so.</p>

<p>Think about it. Intelligence is an advantage out in the wild, but it has its limits. What I mean is, animals have instincts to avoid death, and we know only humans don't live in the moment.</p>

<P>So?</P>

<p>So, to an animal, death is an impossibility. But humans live in all three areas of time, and we all know we can't beat death. So why should we have the instinct to keep on?</p>

<p>You're essentially saying what Shakespeare said but worse.</p>
</div>

<p id="QuoteIndent">Fuck Shakespeare. It's because our brains kept growing when they shouldn't have, and we committed the one-great-sin: knowing that we've all got to die. That's the fault of intelligence. So now you've got a world where everyone in their right fucking mind is killing themselves and leaving only those with the greed instinct to keep them alive. So now we've got a society with all the good people gone, and the world is full of selfish assholes. It's no wonder why civilization is going to shit.</p>
