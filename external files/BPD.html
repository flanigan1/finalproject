<h1>Borderline Personality Disorder and the Mentalizing System </h1>
<h2>The relationship between BPD and Theory of Mind</h2>
<p><i>by Brady Flanigan</a></i></p>
<p>The DSM-IV defines borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts. While the specific cause of BPD is disputed, in recent years neuroimaging studies have established a relationship between reduction in brain regions associated with stress and emotional response and BPD (O’Neill et al, 2012). Specifically, it was found that bilateral hippocampal volume reduction, amygdala volume reduction, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volume reduction were all consistently observed in BPD subjects when compared to healthy controls (HCs). While neuroanatomy plays an important role in BPD, it has also been shown that developmental factors such as early childhood trauma are causally related to BPD later in life (Ball et al, 2009). Much in the same way, genetics has also been strongly implicated in development of BPD. According to one study, the genetic inheritability of BPD was found to be roughly forty percent (Amad et al, 2014). With all this said, it is known that a combination of genetic, developmental, and neuroanatomical factors all work to produce BPD, yet the specific combination of each has yet to be determined. Difficulties in understanding BPD are caused by a number of factors ranging from problems of ecological validity, comorbidity, the tension between correlation and causation, all work to complicate research on borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>A topic less explored however, is the effect of borderline personality disorder on the process of mentalization. Given that BPD is a disorder marked by interpersonal instability, instability of self-image, and emotional dysregulation, some studies have sought to inspect the mechanisms of mentalization in patients with BPD. Mentalization plays a vital social role in a person’s ability to discern the intentions, emotions, and cues of other people. Because of this, many social dysfunctions have been linked in some form to a dysfunction of the mentalizing system. The purpose of this article is to accumulate data from existing studies in an attempt to see how the system of mentalization functions in subjects of BPD, and whether this relationship plays a role in the manifestation of the disorder.</p> 
<p>It is known that a common symptomatic marker of BPD is interpersonal instability stemming primarily from emotional dysregulation. Specifically this refers to the tendency among borderline patients to negatively misattribute the affect of others more negatively than others. In one fmri study it was found that BPD subjects showed greater left amygdala activation than healthy controls when prompted with facial expressions of emotion and tended to misattribute neutral faces as malevolent (Donegan et al, 2003). This misattribution of neutral faces is attributed to hyperactivity of the amygdala and is consistent with earlier findings of reduced amygdala volume in borderline subjects. While the causational relationship between reduced amygdala volume and hyperactivity or vice versa has not been determined, it is nevertheless known that the tendency among borderline subjects to misattribute the intent of others is caused by a dysfunction in the mentalizing system. Moreover, the problem of misattribution is further aggravated by decreased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex compared to HCs, where it was found in another frmi study that decreased vmPFC activity was strongly associated with increased impulsivity (Silbersweig et al, (2007). Evidence for increased impulsivity and high misattribution of neutral faces combine to produce the classic symptoms of interpersonal instability noted in BPD. While one of these traits can be attributed to failures in the brain’s mentalizing system, the other is more closely related to dysfunction in the vmPFC system.</p>
<p>Some studies on the relationship between BPD and the mentalizing system seem to contradict the findings of (Donegan et al, 2003), which indicated a deficiency in the mentalizing systems of borderline patients. Rather, in an experiment designed to test subjects’ ability to mentalize the states of cartoon characters, researchers found that only those who self-reported maternal overprotection, lack of emotional availability, and rejection, in early childhood showed an impaired capacity to mentalize when compared to HCs (Ghiassi et al, 2010). Whereas these findings do appear to contradict (Donegan et al, 2003), their findings cannot necessarily be ruled out because no self-reported measure on childhood trauma was introduced in the 2003 study. It is important to note that in neither study was the ability of subjects with isolated childhood trauma tested for their ability to mentalize the states of others. Because of this, the findings in (Ghiassi et al, 2010) do not necessarily contradict (Donegan et al, 2003). Due to complicated auxiliary factors such as comorbid disorders, the presence of childhood trauma, as well as issues involving the ecological validity of certain experiments, while research has not struggled establishing a correlational relationship between mentalization and BPD, it has had difficulty establishing a causational relationship. For example, in another study exploring the connection between mentalization and BPD, sixty four women with BPD were instructed to watch the “Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition” (MASC) and then take an assessment of character’s intentions in the film, as well as take the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test” (RMET). On the RMET task, BPD patients displayed no impairment in perceiving social cues when compared to healthy subjects. On the MASC however, a test deemed more complex and ecologically valid by the authors than the RMET, BPD patients displayed significant deficiency in perceiving intentions, cues, and emotions (Dziobek et al, 2010). Further findings aligned with (Ghiassi et al, 2010) when the study noted that comorbid PTSD or sexual trauma further negatively predicted success on the MASC. The conclusions the authors drew from these findings indicated that deficiency in mentalization only occurred on tests deemed complicated, such as the MASC. To further complicate the relationship between BPD and diminished mentalization, one study found that under fmri conditions BPD patients not only perceived RMET tasks more accurately than HCs, but they also experienced greater activation of the amygdala, and medial frontal gyrus (Frick et al, 2012). While the hyperactivity of the amygdala is consistent with frmi findings from (Donegan et al, 2003), these findings contradict the body of other studies, which have indicated either a disability to read social cues and intentions, or a disability when performing complex tasks or when presented with a comorbid disorder.</p> 
<p>While the dysfunction in the mentalizing system noted in some studies on BPD patients is disputed, there still needs to exist a therapeutic model for approaching these cases. Since traditional drugs cannot prove effective on issues involving complex social processes such as mentalization, there has been some success in the field of mentalization based psychotherapy (MBT). Designed specifically for subjects of BPD, this form of psychotherapy utilizes cortical brain regions to both reappraise and modify the nature of a person’s behavior through conscious intent. In one study, over a forty five day period severely borderline patients underwent mentalization based therapy, and results showed a considerable reduction in suicidality, suicide attempts, self-harm, and other acts of dangerously impulsive behavior (Bales et al, 2012). By means of changing a patients understanding of their own mental processes and reappraising them or changing them all together, it has been found that BPD subjects can drastically reduce the manifestation of symptoms.</p> 
<p>While there seems to be considerable contention over the mechanisms of mentalization and the mentalizing system in borderline personality disorder, it is generally known that much of the symptoms of BPD are related to an inability to process social stimulus with the same efficiency as healthy individuals. As noted, this has been primarily linked to hyperactivity of the amygdala and dysfunctions of the vmPFC, yet the exact causes of these anatomical changes continues to be disputed, as some studies highlight the importance of factors such as comorbid disorders and childhood trauma. Further studies bring into question the extent to which the mentalizing system dysfunctions compared to healthy individuals and under what circumstances this is most aptly manifest. Nevertheless it cannot be disputed that there exists an important relationship between BPD and the system of mentalization. To begin to truly understand the connection between these two entities further research into the nature of the disorder is needed. Until that time, therapeutic techniques such as MBT work to alleviate symptoms of BPD and allow patients to live more normal lives.</p>
