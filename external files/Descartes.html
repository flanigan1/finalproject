<h1>Descartes, Madness, and the Cogito</h1>
<h2>The failure of Descartes' Meditations</h2>
<p><i>by Brady Flanigan</a></i></p>

<p>The philosophical examinations laid out by Rene Descartes in The <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> and <i>The Discourse on Method</i> sought to establish the validity of human sensory experience, the existence of God and the self, and prove the existence of human freedom. While these texts form the basis of much of modern Western philosophy, Descartes’ inquiries fail to accomplish any of the goals laid out above because the force that tests the validity of his convictions, that is radical doubt, were never extended to all things.</p>

<p>At some point in the process of methodic doubt, the Meditator came across ideas whose clarity he found to be so infallible that he concluded them to be self-evidently true. Thus, he separated these ‘clear and distinct ideas’ from the bulk of other knowable things, and he left them aside for later analysis. These forms of ideas serve as the bedrock for deriving the ‘composite’ proofs the meditator will do later on. If then, these ideas are the pillars of his proofs, it should be clear to any thinker that we must test the ground beneath them. When the Meditator distrusts his senses, it is because he knows that the translation from the external world to the internal world may not be one to one. Just as skyscrapers look like grains of sand from enough distance, even though their sizes do not change, we know that some things are lost in translation, so to speak. In the same way, man thinks either in the language of reason or madness. For any person to establish the credibility of clear and distinct ideas, they must prove the underlying assertion that they are not mad—that the process which gives ideas to them so clearly is not a faulty one.</p>

<p>To do this of course, would require entertaining something outside of reason—that being madness. As Foucault noted in <i>Histoire de la folie</i>, “By a strange act of force, the classical age was to reduce to silence the madness whose voices the Renaissance had just liberated” (Foucault 38). That is to say, the possibility of madness in <i>The Meditations</i> is largely ignored. On several occasions the idea is explicitly rejected. The first is prominently given in paragraph one of <i>The Discourse</i> with Descartes’ claim that “’Good sense’ or ‘reason’—is naturally equal in all men, and consequently that the diversity of our opinions does not arise because some are more reasonable than others but solely because we direct our thoughts along different paths and do not attend to the same things” (Descartes 20). The choice in claiming this so early in the text indicates nothing other than the author’s knowledge of just how devastating an argument against reason itself can be. Were it not for the destruction potential of this argument towards the Meditator’s thinking, there would be little reason to feature it so prominently. The meditator remarks a similar sentiment in <i>The Meditations</i>:</p>

<p id="QuoteIndent">Although the senses occasionally deceive us with respect to objects which are very small or in the distance, there are many other beliefs about which doubt is quite impossible, even though they are derived from the senses—for example, that I am here, sitting by the fire, wearing a winter dressing-gown, holding this piece of paper in my hands, and so on. Again, how could it be denied that these hands or this whole body are mine? Unless perhaps I were to liken myself to madmen, whose brains are so damaged by the persistent vapors of melancholia that they firmly maintain they are kings when they are paupers, or say they are dressed in purple when they are naked…But such people are insane, and I would be equally mad if I took anything from them as a model for myself (Descartes 77).</p> 

<p>This passage illuminates the system which lies beneath and in support of clear and distinct ideas. It is not that clear and distinct ideas are self-evident on their own power, but rather they are self-evident only so far as the Meditator does not doubt his reason. It is only with the confidence he is not a madman that he knows clearly and distinctly he sits by the fire. These kinds of claims specifically reinforce the untested belief that reason is a solid system. When viewed in this way, it becomes clear that the Meditator sees clear and distinct ideas as extensions of reason in the purest form. Therefore, the solidity of clear and distinct ideas is grounded on the solidity of reason. This will be shown to be problematic as both the existence of the self, the existence of god, and the existence of the external world relies on the Meditator’s unsupported reason.</p>
	
<p>While the first step in the Meditator’s proof after the introduction of radical doubt is towards the establishment of the cogito, it is best understood that the proof for the existence of God in the third meditation is the primary pillar which grounds the validity of the cogito. Therefore, it follows that a weakness in the proof of God’s existence will signal a weakness in the cogito.  The way in which the Meditator goes about proving God exists is in many ways a modification of Anselm’s proof of God’s existence. The first step is the admission that a conception of God exists in the mind. Whether I believe in his existence or not, I know I have a conception of God. From here the Meditator claims the cause of an idea must have as much formal reality as it does objective reality. That is, since the Meditator has an idea of God, but he knows he is not an infinite being, the idea of God must have come from the external world and thus God must exist. This proof proves satisfactory to Descartes because even if God was an evil deceiver, as he later entertains, it still does not follow that God can deceive him of his existence. The Meditator concludes he knows God to exist. The only question is as to whether his nature is good or evil. One fault that lies in this however, is that the Meditator assumes his conception of God is in fact infinite. Could it not be true that his idea of God is no more finite than his idea of a chair? If this were true, then the proof of God as external to the Meditator’s mind is disrupted. The answer Descartes gives is on the basis of clear and distinct ideas. It is readily obvious to him that he conceives God as an infinite entity, but if God truly is beyond the reason of man, and we know he could deceive us to think he is finite when he is in fact infinite, he could also then deceive us to think he is infinite when he is finite. This must be true because if God could not create contradictions he would not be infinite. Given that possibility, the existence of God as external is undermined.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, meditations II and III seek to read the mind of God and discover whether God exists as an evil deceiver:</p>

<p id="QuoteIndent">Since I have no cause to think that there is a deceiving God, and I do not yet know for sure whether there is a God at all, any reason for doubt which depends simply on this belief is a very slight reason and, so to speak, metaphysical one. But in order to remove even this slight reason for doubt, as soon as the opportunity arises I must examine whether there is a God, and, if there is, whether he can be a deceiver (Descartes 88).</p>

<p>After consideration about the nature of God, the Meditator concludes God cannot be a deceiver. This is said to be true because, “For in every case of trickery or deception some imperfection is to be found; and although the ability to deceive appears to be an evidence of malice or weakness, and so cannot apply to God” (Descartes 99). That is, for god to be an infinite being, he must contain no imperfections and therefore be clearly good and not bent on deceiving man.</p>

	<p>This is the moment when the meditator ills, however. In his essay “Cogito and the History of Madness,” Derrida contends that the evil deceiver question is the moment Descartes entertains pure madness. The absence of analysis on ‘madness’ as “The persistent vapours of melancholia” to Derrida is nothing more than the recognition that it is not encompassing enough in its doubt. To him, the evil deceiver argument is, </p>

<p id="QuoteIndent">The possibility of a madness that is no longer a disorder of the body, of the object, the body-object outside the boundaries of the <i>res cogitans</i>, outside the boundaries of the policed city, secure in its existence as thinking subjectivity, but is a madness that will bring subversion to pure thought and to its purely intelligible objects, to the field of its clear and distinct ideas, to the realm of the mathematical truths which escape natural doubt (Derrida 53).</p>

<p> In many ways this is true, insofar as the evil deceiver hypothesis is the only thing that can superficially address the totality of madness. The problem with this method of analysis is that the evil deceiver argument is a form of madness itself. When the Meditator concluded that God is a being of both infinite formal and infinite objective reality, he also concluded thusly that God is beyond the reach of human reason. This is why, as noted above, God can be in the problematic position of creating contradictions. Given this knowledge, it should be clear that when the Meditator claims he knows God to be good, he really makes a claim that limits the nature of God. If God is the composition of all things in the world, he retains the characteristics of none of them. To talk about God’s qualities is meaningless because his existence is necessarily beyond the reach of reason. To talk about the question of an evil deceiver, as Derrida correctly pointed out, is a form of madness, but to talk about god as a being of infinite benevolence is also a form of madness. It is true that Descartes brushes up against madness in meditation II, but only because he seeks to do what the mad have done before him and read the mind of God. If our reason cannot be insured against the benevolence of God, then our capacity to know the truth of anything at all is powerfully disrupted.  
Nevertheless, Derrida offers a second instance where he sees the meditator as entertaining the idea of madness, and that is through the vehicle of dreaming:</p>

<p id="QuoteIndent">The reference to dreams does not, therefore, fall short of a madness potentially respected or even excluded by Descartes: quite the contrary. It constitutes, in the methodical order which here is ours, the hyperbolic exasperation of the hypothesis of madness. This latter affected only certain areas of sensory perception, and in a contingent and partial way... What must be grasped here is that from this <i>point of view the sleeper</i>, or the dreamer, is madder than the madman. Or, at least the dreamer, insofar as concerns the problem of knowledge which interests which Descartes here, is further from true perception than the madman (Derrida 47).</p>

<P>There are a number of problems with this interpretation. While Derrida is right in saying that dreams are an important consideration of madness, in terms of the inconsideration of faulty reason, the question of the dreamer as the madman does nothing to solidify that our thinking is good. The only way to properly do this is through the truest consideration of non-reason—the most sincere consideration of madness. Unlike Derrida’s limited sight of madness as the evil deceiver, the dreamer, or the lunatic gorged with vapors, the truest consideration of madness is a system of reason wholly different from our own—one that from the perspective of anyone set in reason, would appear as a form of madness. Because of this, dreaming is an example that fails in considering madness. Dreamers are delusional, but they are not mad. Much like the analogy of the painter, a dreamer can create strange things while asleep, but those things are created from the unique combination of things that exist in waking life—things that exist within a system of defined reason. To this effect, the use of dreams as considerations of madness are no better than considering waking life itself. Given that dreams constitute a re-ordering of waking life—a re-ordering of reason, not a disruption of reason itself, Derrida’s claim that the Meditator uses dreams as a tool to entertain madness does not hold up to scrutiny.
</P>

<P>With the existence of God and the exploration of madness thoroughly undermined, the cogito, as we will come to see, will itself be undermined. To Descartes, the cogito’s validity is delivered through the apparent truth of clear and distinct ideas, which as noted earlier, although not discussed explicitly in <i>The Meditations</i>, is fundamentally grounded on the understanding that reason is not faulty. Nevertheless, this is not the only fault within the cogito. One prominent fault was historically delivered by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his posthumous work <i>On Certainty</i>. To begin to understand the nature of this criticism, let us begin by imagining that the language of reason is in fact not faulty. Even if this were true, the cogito would still not be on confident ground. This is so because even if the system of reason is trustworthy, all thought is grounded in language. This creates two problems for the self-sufficiency of the Meditator’s proofs. First this is problematic because, as Wittgenstein noted in the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, there is no such thing as a private language. That is to say, that language is fundamentally a device of the external world. Seeing as how the Meditator has undermined the nature of corporeal things through radical doubt, the cogito cannot work if it is hinged on the external world. Second, it can be said that the cogito cannot be arrived at without the tools of language. While Descartes conceives of an implicit ‘privileged access’ to the self, it is not readily apparent this exists. In this regard, Descartes conceives of all forms of clear and distinct ideas as under a form of privileged access that does not require the tools of language to conceive. </P>

<p>Given a more contemporary understanding of the relationship between language and thinking, it is best seen, as noted in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that your understanding of language is the filter from which you see life. An individual without language could likely never conceive of the cogito. Even if this language lacks words or sounds of any kind—what some anthropologists call ‘mentalese’—this form of language is still predicated by the perception of things in the world, and rarely extends beyond conception of first order predicates. Foundational linguist Benjamin Whorf argued a similar point throughout his career:</p>

<P ID="QuoteIndent"> We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated (Whorf 212). </p>

<P>The point made here is that language is the entity that gives to us our conceptions of the world. The Cartesian idea of the self as mind, the conception of thinking, and the idea of existence are all concepts delivered to us through the medium of language, which as Wittgenstein noted, is inherently external to the self. Because of this disruption of self-sufficiency, the cogito ceases to function as the grounding for inquiry.</P>

	<P>One more noteworthy criticism of the cogito is derived from discussion of first and second order predicates. It is not readily apparent that existence is a first order predicate, as Descartes makes it out to be. That is to say, existence is the pre-requisite for an object to possess properties. Existence itself is not a property. If an object is presumed not to exist, that is to have neither formal nor objective reality, then it is void of properties. It can be known that existence is a second order predicate because the removal of it from an object does not change the nature of the object. For example, if I remove the properties of green and waxy and sweet from an apple, it ceases to be an apple. That is because these types of claims are first order predicates. They make a claim about the world. If I look at an apple, and remove the ‘property’ of existence, nothing is different.  Because all things with properties have the presupposition of existence instantiated in them, what the Meditator really says when he declares “Je pense, donc je suis” or “I am thinking, therefore I exist” is “I believe I exist, I know I am thinking, therefore I exist.” When viewed in this way, the tautological nature of the Meditator’s proof is more immediately apparent. Kant provides an articulate critique to this effect in <i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>: “The <strong>I think</strong> must be able to accompany all my representations: for otherwise something would be represented in me that could not be thought at all, which is as much as to say that the representation would either be impossible or else at least would be nothing to me” (Kant 131). The meaning conveyed here is the same as the question of a first and second order predicate. The use of the cogito in this way decays into Cartesian circle that undermines its potency as a whole.</P>

	<p>Thus far we have seen the destabilization of the cogito, God, and radical doubt. As the evidence has indicated, the epistemological inquiries of Rene Descartes failed to achieve any of the lofty goals they set out to achieve. Among these were the establishment of the self, God, and the existence of the external world. While the work laid out is very astute and methodical in its analysis, it cannot break free from the weight of its own ambitions. That is, primarily under the weight of radical doubt—the looming possibility of madness, but also the other various criticisms brought forth, the Meditator’s mission collapses. The main and strongest fault among these was the power of the madness argument. Even the arguments the Meditator laid out in hopes of disproving this cripplingly possibility cannot escape its gravitational pull. It is under this power that the proofs in <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> and <i>The Discourse on Method</i> fail entirely.</P>
